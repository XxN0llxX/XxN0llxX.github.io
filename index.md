# Conditions, 9/21/18
This week in python we had learned a lot about conditions and how to make condtions and use them correctly making the program run better at a faster rate, and also mking the programs work with different variables, and we had learned on how to make a number game in which mine didnt work at all no matter what i had done, we have also learned making the variables count towards other things like homework and things of that nature, which was very complicated.
