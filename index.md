everything i remember from this week is that i had learned on how to install linux, and we had started updating my 16.04 linux, 
and i started using linux, i switched to galaxy operating system, then i had also learned on how to change alot of my settings on linux, even though im not very well inclined. The second things is i had signed up for visual studio.
